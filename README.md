# AI-Powered-Dynamic-Renewable-Energy-Grid-Optimization

Overview
This project focuses on optimizing the integration of renewable energy sources (solar, wind, hydro) into the power grid using SQL, Python, and Power BI. The goal is to minimize energy wastage, ensure grid stability, and enhance real-time monitoring.
Problem Statement
Traditional power grids struggle to manage fluctuating renewable energy supply, leading to inefficiencies such as surplus energy wastage or energy shortages. This project leverages machine learning forecasting and real-time data visualization to create a dynamic energy grid.

Technologies Used
â€¢	SQL â€“ Data extraction, transformation, and storage
â€¢	Python â€“ Predictive analytics using ARIMA/LSTM models
â€¢	Power BI â€“ Real-time monitoring and dashboard visualization

Key Features
âœ… Energy Forecasting Model: Uses ARIMA and Random Forest to predict renewable energy generation.
âœ… Grid Stability Index: Analyzes energy consumption trends and optimizes storage.
âœ… Real-Time Dashboards: Power BI visualizations for decision-making.
âœ… Data-Driven Insights: Helps reduce energy wastage and improve efficiency.

Datasets
The project utilizes 30 days of renewable energy data, including:
â€¢	Renewable energy generation (solar, wind, hydro)
